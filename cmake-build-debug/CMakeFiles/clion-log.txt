CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at zadania_lab06/CMakeLists.txt:6 (add_executable):
  add_executable cannot create target "homework_lab05" because another target
  with the same name already exists.  The existing target is an executable
  created in source directory
  "/home/michal/Projects/clion/JiPP2/zadania_lab05".  See documentation for
  policy CMP0002 for more details.
